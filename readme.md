### Project Description
This project is the final assignment for the "Internet of Things" lecture offered in the AI Bachelor program at Hochschule Fulda. The goal is to create a smart IoT device that can be controlled via an Android app, utilizing the MQTT protocol for communication.

---

### Project Goals
The project is divided into several phases, each with its own objectives and status:

- **Phase 1**: Adafruit's Neopixel library translation and implementation (for device needs). ✓
- **Phase 2**: RMT Protocol implementation. ✓
- **Phase 3**: MQTT Protocol implementation and Mosquitto Broker setup. ✓
- **Phase 4**: Android application development. ✗
- **Phase 5**: Testing and bug fixes. ✗
- **Phase 6 (stretch goal)**: Update RMT protocol to the newest version (currently using a deprecated version). ✗

---

### Materials Needed
To replicate this project, you will need the following:

- **Hardware**:
  - ESP32 microcontroller.
  - WS2813 Mini (24 LED Ring).
  - Android phone (for testing the app).

- **Software**:
  - PlatformIO with the Espressif toolchain.
  - Mosquitto MQTT Broker (optional; a public broker can be used instead).
